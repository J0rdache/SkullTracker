# AI-Projects
Collection of projects in fields related to AI in various stages of completion

## Projects
### 1. [Haircut Recommender](./haircut-recommender/)
**Description:** Facial detection using OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifiers. Detects face type / structure and gives list of recommended hairstyles
**Tech Stack:** Python, OpenCV
**Highlights:**
-   Real-time webcam input

### 2. [Meeting Place Idea](./meeting-place-idea)
**Description:** Prototype app concept that suggests ideal meeting locations between two or more users based on geographic midpoint and available venues (e.g., cafés, libraries).
**Tech Stack:** Python, Flask, Google Maps API
**Features:**
- Calculates optimal midpoint between users
- Fetches venues using Maps API
- (Planned) Integration with user preferences for smarter recommendations

### 3. [Nearest Face Detection and Lock - On](./nearest-face-detect/)
**Description:** Real-time facial detection system using OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifiers. Tracks and locks onto the nearest face in the frame and updates dynamically.
**Tech Stack:** Python, OpenCV
**Highlights:**
-   Real-time webcam input
-   CSRT/KCF tracker integration for accuracy and speed
-   Modular, expandable code design

### 4. [NLTK Text Tone Processing](./nltk-text-tone-processing/)
**Description:** Sentiment analysis web app that processes user input text and determines tone using **NLTK’s VADER model**.
**Tech Stack:** Python, Flask, NLTK, CSV, Chart.js
**Features:**
- Real-time tone detection
- Data logging in CSV
- Graphical sentiment history

## What I’m Exploring Next
- Object detection with YOLOv8
- Vision Transformers (ViT) for image classification
- Neural networks with PyTorch
- Expanding Flask apps into full-stack dashboards
